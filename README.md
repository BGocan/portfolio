# Bruno Gocan Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my work across mechanical engineering, prototyping, 3D printing and process automation.

The site includes projects such as the Aethera Smart Mask, the HEAL health booth concept, 3D printing iterations using the Bambu Labs P1P and my work improving API testing processes in financial software.

Everything is structured to highlight how I approach problems, design solutions and improve systems through practical engineering and continuous learning.
